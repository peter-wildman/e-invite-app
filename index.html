    <h1> the belt </h1>

    <p id="top-line-par"> Hi. It’s Pete Wildman here. </p>
    <p>  You are reading this because I would love to invite you to soften the belt with me. I am inviting you to share your belt with me as an act of trust. I trust you and I would love to sit with you and others and talk about that. </p>
    <h2> My story of the belt that has lead me here. </h2>
    <p> A big part of this softening of the belt comes from the belt as an object that holds memories of domestic violence for me. Getting the belt from my father was a moment filled with fear and anger for my younger self. As I have grown and healed from these experiences I have learnt to trust male presenting people in a way that has lead me to want to explore this trust with you. </p>
    <h2> Stories of your belts. </h2>
    <p> I am looking forward to exploring the stories of your belts. This act of sharing stories could be an act of softening in itself. I am curious to see all the wonderful things that lead to you getting your belt. Your belt habits. How do you even buy a belt? </p>
    <h2>An exhibition </h2>
    <p> I would love to have an exhibition as a way to share some of these stories to the broader community. Showing your belt in different ways would be the idea, embroidering a quote or making a strange kinetic sculptural extravaganza - who knows, I’d love the stories to be the guide.</p>
    <p> I would be open to all forms of belt giving - photo, lend but no embellishments or transforming your belt into something else.</p>
    <h2> Gathering together or something on the side </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Goal is a group catch up</li>
      <li> I'd love to document a conversation</li>
      <li> Nothing to be published without direct permission from you</li>
      <li> Can meet in any other way is above does not work</li>
    </ul>
    <p> I'd love to hear back from you either way. Let's chat and see if there is something we can do together.</p>
    <p class="sign-off"> In kindness,</p>
